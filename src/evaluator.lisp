;;;; evaluator.lisp -- Part 2. Write the eight functions below.
;;;;
;;;; The toy language is a Lisp-1. One namespace holds both variables and
;;;; functions, so a variable bound to a closure is callable in operator
;;;; position and (f 1) works with no FUNCALL. The CLISP hosting this file is a
;;;; Lisp-2, which is why the host needs FUNCALL and #' where the toy language
;;;; needs neither. ANALYSIS.md asks you about that difference.
;;;;
;;;; An environment is an association list: ((name . value) (name . value) ...).
;;;; The grader scores E1 to E4 separately, so finish them in order and keep
;;;; every group you get right.
;;;;
;;;; The grammar, in full:
;;;;
;;;;   expr := number
;;;;         | symbol
;;;;         | (+ expr expr) | (- expr expr) | (* expr expr)
;;;;         | (let ((name expr) ...) body)
;;;;         | (lambda (name ...) body)
;;;;         | (operator-expr argument-expr ...)

;;; E1 -- numbers and symbols.

The first match wins, so an inner binding shadows an outer one that shares its
name. Signal an error when NAME is not bound at all."

        (cdr pair)
        (error "Unbound variable: ~S" name))))

;;; E2 -- prefix arithmetic.

(defun eval-operands (exprs env)
  "Every expression in EXPRS, evaluated in the same ENV, as a list.

arguments and MAPCAR hands its function one."

    (error "operator must be of type +, -, or *")))

through."
